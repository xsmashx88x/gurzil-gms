*___Exotic Weapon___: The following list of exotics are strong on Psi-Op Cosmodrome.

***Wish-Ender, Revision Zero, Sunshot, Ticcu's Divination***

Wish-Ender: Wish-Ender is strong for ad-clear as well as stunning barrier champions in one arrow. Since it has intrinsic barrier, you'll just need an unstoppable weapon to pair. This season we have unstoppable bow and hand cannon. You can use any hand cannon/bow because champion weapons are overcharged, so it doesn't matter if it is arc, solar, or void. All are buffed 25%.

Revision Zero: (This needs to be tested and may be removed later) Revision Zero was buffed twice this season. Pulses received a 12.5% buff and revision specifically received a 100% damage increase against champions. Revision has intrinsic barrier stunning so you are covered there. You'll just a unstoppable weapon to pair. This season we have unstoppable bow and hand cannon. You can use any hand cannon/bow because champion weapons are overcharged, so it doesn't matter if it is arc, solar, or void. All are buffed 25%.

Sunshot: Sunshot is very strong ad-clear and with the solar artifact mods this season and feels incredible. We have unstoppable hand cannon this season so you are covered there, so you'll just need a barrier weapon. Unfortunately we only anti-barrier sidearm. It doesn't matter if the sidearm is kinetic, stasis, or strand because all champion stunning weapons are overcharged. All are buffed 25%.

Ticcu's Divination: Ticcu's is great for ad-clear and since we have unstoppable bow you are covered there. You just need a barrier weapon to pair.  Unfortunately we only anti-barrier sidearm. It doesn't matter if the sidearm is kinetic, stasis, or strand because all champion stunning weapons are overcharged. All are buffed 25%.

___Heavy Weapon___: Machine Gun (This could change after some testing)

Since it's a battleground ad density is a real issue and machine guns help immensly with that. The permanent surge is solar so a solar machine is buffed 25% every week on every gm all season. The other two surges are stasis and strand, so depending on the week a stasis/strand machine gun can be strong as well.

___Armor Mods___

The only mods that really matter are what's on your chest and legs. On chest you want resist mods. Since it's void threat I would run 3 void resists or 2 void resists and 1 concussive dampener.
On legs you always want a scavenger for your heavy. Scavengers increase ammo pickups by roughly 75%. So just match your scavenger to the machine gun that you have.

Solar machine gun --> solar scavenger
Stasis machine gun --> stasis scavenger
Strand machine gun --> strand scavenger
